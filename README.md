# beowulf_cluster_streamlined_setup
Scripts to speed up and simplify the process of setting up your own beowulf computing cluster. Prerequisites: two or more computers running linux (tested on debian based systems); hardware for typing on the computer, moving the mouse, and viewing the screen; and an internet connection on the target computers (only needed temporarily for installing software during the beginning of setup_part_1). To setup, disconnect computer(s) from the internet and run setup_part_1.sh on all target machines. Once done, then proceed to running setup_part_2.sh and testing the cluster.
